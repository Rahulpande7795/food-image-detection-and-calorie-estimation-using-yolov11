This project focuses on **automated food detection and calorie estimation from images** using the YOLOv11 object detection framework. It detects multiple food items in a single image and provides an estimated calorie value for each detected item.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 📸 Detects multiple food items in a single image  
- 📦 Predicts bounding boxes with food labels  
- 🔢 Estimates calorie values for detected food items  
- ⚡ Fast and efficient inference using YOLOv11  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Input images are processed using a trained YOLOv11 model  
2. Food items are detected with bounding boxes and labels  
3. Each detected food item is mapped to an estimated calorie value  
4. Outputs are saved for visualization and further analysis
